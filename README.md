# Small-WInd-Turbine-Siting

Weather data is both intrinsically interesting and potentially useful when correlate dwith other types of data. For example, wildfire spread is potentially related to weather conditions, demand for cabs is famously known to be correlated with weahter conditions and use of city bikes is probably corelated with weather in teteresting ways as well.

Here, though, trends in data are summarized and visualized based on average wind speed, changes in wind speed and changes in wind direction. Lastly, a site quality calculator has been calculated to identify best cities for placing a small wind turbine on homes.

Going forward, energy output data from various wind turbines along with economic and tax informatin will be combinded with this data set to generate economic numbers to help consumers decide if it is economically viable to place a small wind turbine on their homes.
